In a list , there is no natural way to have indexing like an array . This can raise some issues. To solve this problem ,
List Iterators come to rescue . 
This list iterator includes the following functions :
1) getCurrent() ---- returns the link currently pointed to by the iterator 
2) nextLink() ---- Moves the iterator to the next link
3) reset() --- Sets the iterator to the start of the list 
4) atEnd() ---- returns true if the iterator is at the end of the list 
5) insertAfter() --- Inserts an element after the link being currently pointed to by the iterator 
6) deleteCurrent() --- deletes the link being pointed to by the iterator 
7) InsertBefore() - Inserts a link before the link currently pointed to by the iterator 
8) displayList() -- Displays the entire list
